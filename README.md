# Homework TodoList for kids

We have as a shool work in the course Dynamic webdevelop to create a basic API with the CRUD as base, create, read, update and delete.
My small program that I created is a homework todo app.
You can view all homeworks, add, change and delete a homework.

We had to create one more GET for higher score. So I created an GET that sorts out the homeworks that has to be done first, the closest date.
